This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# CV-GRAFFITI

An application for drawing in the browser.

## Instructions

1. First checkout the respository from github.
2. Navigate into the directory. `cd cv-graffiti`
3. `/node_modules` have been included for ease of use, but in case this causes an issue, you can `npm install`

## Running the application

$ npm start
(port 3000)

## Requirements

#### Write a simple application called "Graffiti" which allows you to draw/paint inside the browser. One side of this application (the code running in one of the browser windows) should be built using React with Redux.

I made the assumption that for this project functionality was more important than presentation, and prioritized as such.

## Assumptions & Limitations

1. basic functionality is more important than expanded functionality, and prioritized as such.
2. the application would not support a history of drawn objects, namely, no undo/redo, selection, or selective deletion.
3. leaving the canvas would trigger a "drawing complete" event
4. that we did not need to persist the drawings by storing into a database

## TODOs & Known Issues

1. Unit testing needs to be implemented
2. error logging was not implemented
3. There are a number of places where data should be validated
